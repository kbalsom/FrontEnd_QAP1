        <p>
          The American crow is a large bird known for its distinctive black feathers. 
          Unlike other types of black birds, the crow's beak, legs, and feet are also black. Male crows are usually larger than females.</p>

        <audio src="./audio/caw.mp3" autoplay controls></audio>
        <p>The American crow is known for its rapid <em>caaw-caaw-caaw</em> call. However, the crows are capable of making a wide variety of sounds, and have also proven to be able to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/explore/savingearth/the-cleverness-of-crows">mimic</a> the sounds of other animals, and even humans. Crows communicate with each other frequently, with different sounds having different meanings. Each crow has an individual voice, allowing them to recognize each other by sound alone.

       American crows, as their name suggests, can be found all through the <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>. They are also found in Canada, 
       below the Artic Circle, and in northern Mexico. In most regions, crows are permanents residents, meaning they stay 
       in the same area all year round. However, some crows in Canada migrate south to escape the harsher winters.
       Crows can be found in both natural and urban environments, taking up residence everywhere from forests to parking lots.
       Crows are social, and gather in groups of thousands to millions for the night (except during breeding season.)

    <div id="diet">
      <h1>Diet</h1>
      <p>
        American crows are omnivores. An <dfn id="def-omnivore">omnivore</dfn> is an organism that survives off both plant and animal matter. American crows eat pretty much everything they can find. They consume a wide variety of food, including but not limited to: 
        nuts, grains, seeds, eggs of other birds, carcasses, insects, and fish. 
        Crows are predators that prey on small animals, like mice, frogs, and small snakes.
        They also consume scraps of human food, which causes them to scavenge around dumps, 
        garbage containers, restaurants, and farms. <br />
        It is beacuse of the crow's varied diet that it can live in a large variety of habitats. However, urban crows that subside mostly on human food and 
        garbage can run into health problems, including 
        <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2214371-city-crows-may-have-high-cholesterol-because-they-eat-fast-food/#:~:text=Crows%20living%20in%20urban%20areas,Hamilton%20College%20in%20New%20York.">high cholestrol</a> 
        from fast food! Crows usually eat wherever they find food, but sometimes take the food up into trees. 
        They will cough up inedible parts as pellets during digestion.

      <h1>Reproduction & Nesting</h1>
      <p>
        American crows have monogamous, meaning they have one mating partner for live. 
        Crows reach breeding age at 2 years, but usually stay with their parents until age 4 or 5.
        During nesting season, which begins around April, the mated pair will build a nest in trees or bushes. 
        The female lays eggs, which are incubated for 18 days. When the babies hatch, they stay in the nest for 36 days, until they can fly.
        Crows live in families, with the young from previous breeding seasons staying with their parents and helping with the new hatchlings.
        They also help protect the nest from predators that eat the eggs, such as snakes, raccoons, other birds, and cats.

      <p>
        Crows are extremely <strong>intelligent.</strong> Relative to to their size, their brains are the same size as that of a primate. Here are some examples of their cunning:
        <ul>
          <li>While a few other types of birds also use tools, crows are the only ones that can make new ones. 
            In experiments, crows that had never encountered wire before were able to quickly fashion a tool out of it. 
            <cite>(https://www.sciencealert.com/crows-are-so-smart-they-can-make-compound-tools-out-of-multiple-parts)</cite></li>
          <li>Crows understand the concept of water displacement, something humans don't learn until they are 5 to 7 years old.</li>
          <li>Crows can recognize human faces, and communicate information about that person to other crows. If a human is considered a threat, they will teach their 
            offspring and others to avoid or even attack that person. They hold a particular grudge against scientists who tag and release them.
            <cite>(https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/crows-hold-grudges-a4484146.html)</cite> </li>
          <li>Crows are adaptable and observant. They pbserve their environments, then use it to their advantage. For example, they have learned to drop nuts on highways 
            so the cars will crack open the shell. <cite>(https://www.pbs.org/lifeofbirds/brain/index.html)</cite></li>
          <li>When a crow dies, other crows will crowd around. Scientists believe they are conducting an <a href="https://www.livescience.com/53283-why-crows-hold-funerals.html">investigation,</a>
             trying to figure out how it died, and therefore how they can avoid the same fate.</li>
        </ul>
